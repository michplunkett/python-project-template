# Python üêç Project Template
This repository is a template for a python üêç project using the `uv` container. The intent is to do all the basic
lifting for a python project so that people can hit the ground running with their ideas.

### To make this project your own
1. Create a new repository, [using this one as a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
2. Change the `project` folder name to the kebab-case name of your project.
3. Update the information in the `pyproject.toml` file with your project's and your personal information.
4. Update the information in the `CODEOWNERS` file so that it uses your GitHub ID and the kebab-case name of your project folder.

### üêç by Default (Feel free to delete this after creating your project)
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/): This serves as the codebase formatter and linter.
- [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): This is the project's means of communicating with external APIs.
- [responses](https://github.com/getsentry/responses): This is used in conjunction with Pytest and Requests to mock API calls in the test module.

### Project Requirements
- `uv` version: `0.5.7`
- Download at: [link](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

### Instructions to Run the Project
1. Go into the base directory of the repository and type `make env` or `uv env` into the terminal.
2. Use the `make run` command.

### Technical Notes

- `make env`: Creates or activates a `uv` virtual environment.
- `make lint`: Runs `pre-commit`.
- `make run`: Runs the `main` function in the `project` folder.
